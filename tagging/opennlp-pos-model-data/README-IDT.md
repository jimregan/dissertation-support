# IrishDependencyTreebank

This treebank development formed a significant part of a PhD thesis. The treebank contains 1020 trees, and is annotated according to a dependency annotation scheme designed specifically for the Irish language. 

The annotation guide is available in Appendix A of the thesis [Lynn, 2016] (http://www.nclt.dcu.ie/~tlynn/Teresa_PhDThesis_final.pdf)


The following publications also contain relevant work, although most of their content is also in the thesis:
